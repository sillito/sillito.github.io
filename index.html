<p>We are a company focused on intense face-to-face learning
in Calgary. Our courses are for teams that want to quickly get
started making software on a new platform, or just 
explore new ways to build software.</p>

<p>Developing great software starts with great people. 
People that deeply understand their languages, frameworks 
and tools. But also people that
understand the best ideas from other frameworks and 
the field of computer science generally.</p>

develop their 
first a application in a new language or framework. At the same
time the fundamental principles of the technology will be covered
for a strong foundation
for continued learning. Our hands on courses include:</p>
